metalsmith-seo-checker
==========================

This plugin provides a simple way to ensure that front matter values regarding SEO are valid.

You can provide defaults for SEO parameters, or true to ensure they are required. This should
be combined with something in your templating language that places these values where they
belong. An example header that uses handlebars templating can be seen at
`/examples/seo-header.html`
